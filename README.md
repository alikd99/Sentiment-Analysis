# Sentiment Analysis on Text Data

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques in Python. It involves cleaning and preprocessing text data, vectorizing it, and training models to classify sentiments as positive or negative.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `codeSeniment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
- `data/`: Directory to hold input datasets (if available).
- `models/`: Saved models or checkpoints (optional).

## 📊 Key Features

- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF.
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or other classifiers.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Clean, modular code inside a Jupyter notebook.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
